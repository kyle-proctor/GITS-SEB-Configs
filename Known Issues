Encountered an error "ERR_CONNECTION_RESET (101)" when starting SEB (after entering password and closing prohibited processes). This is a browser related issue,
usually relating to Google Chrome but not necessarily. It can also affect Edge, Firefox, and others. Solution is to use a different browser to run SEB. Current 
workaround is to start a different browser than Chrome on the Candidate's computer and then type in the SEB Exam extension URL.
