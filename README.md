Location to report and debug issues with Safe Exam Browser Exam Configuration files as used by Proctors of Gainesville Independent Testing Services, LLC


Under "Code" you will find the most up-to-date versions of the SEB configuration files. Use these to start an Exam/Review and please pay attention to whether
these are for Windows or MacOS X operating systems. To ensure the safest testing environment please make sure you are using the most up-to-date version and for
their intended operating systems.

These configuration files work with SEB version 3.2.0

How to:

Simply copy the .seb extension files to the candidates computer and then double click to launch an Exam/Review straight into a secure SEB session.
SEB will then ask for a password. 
To exit SEB after finishing a testing session use Ctrl-Q (Windows), or CMD-Q (MacOS X)



If you encounter any difficulties using SEB with these extensions please create a new issue under "Issues" at the top and I will investigate.
