# GITS-SEB-Configs
Location to report and debug issues with Safe Exam Browser Exam Configuration files


Under code you will find the most up-to-date versions of the SEB configuration files. Use these to start an Exam/Review and please pay attention to whether
these are for Windows or MacOS X operating systems. To ensure the safest testing environment please make sure you are using the most up-to-date version and for
their intended operating systems.

How to:

Simply copy the .seb extension files to the candidates computer and then double click to launch an Exam/Review straight into a secure SEB session.


If you encounter any difficulties using SEB with these extensions please create a new issue under "Issues" at the top and I will investigate.
